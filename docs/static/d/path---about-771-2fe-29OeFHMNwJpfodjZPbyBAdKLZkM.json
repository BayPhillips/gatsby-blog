My name is Bay Phillips and I'm a software engineer who's been living in New York City for over 7 years now. I've been programming since the early 2000's and haven't stopped since.</p>\n<h3>Who I am</h3>\n<p>I'm not all that interesting, I promise. I grew up in central New Jersey and attended <a href=\"https://www.lawrenceville.edu\" title=\"Lawrenceville\">The Lawrenceville School</a> for high school where I got my first taste of programming. After that, I attended the <a href=\"https://www.rpi.edu\" title=\"RPI\">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> where I majored in Information Technology Web Sciences (a mouthful, I know) while also meeting lots of my lifelong friends.</p>\n<p>I'm engaged to the love of my life, <a href=\"https://www.headstandsandheels.com\" title=\"Headstands And Heels\">Melanie</a>, and we're slated to get married in the Spring of 2019. I can't wait for this next part of my life and where it takes me ðŸ˜€.</p>\n<h3>Where I am right now</h3>\n<p>I've had the privledge of working at <a href=\"https://www.plated.com\">Plated</a> for the past 3+ years, initially as an iOS Engineer, but now as a Senior Engineering Manager. I've always loved cooking, and being able to combine my favorite hobby with my career has been an incredible blessing. Not surprising, <a href=\"https://www.plated.com/careers\">we're very much hiring!</a></p>\n<p>More to come in the near future...</p>"}}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"about-771","internalComponentName":"ComponentAbout","path":"/about","component":"/home/circleci/workspace/src/templates/contentfulPage.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-contentful-page-js","context":{"slug":"about"},"updatedAt":1531074520559,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/home/circleci/workspace/src/templates/contentfulPage.js","slug":"about"}}
