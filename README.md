# Bay's New Blog
This is my next attempt at figuring out what is going on with static website site builders while still using an API to drive its content.

# Tooling used
* GatsbyJS
* Contentful
* UIKit
* GitHub Pages

# How to run
* `npm run dev` to develop locally.
* `npm run generate` to build for production. Add and commit files and push to the repository for the changes to be made live.

# Things to do
- [ ] Proper formatting on blog posts
- [ ] Break out the blog portion to its own namespace (`/blog`)
- [ ] Create a contact form page
- [ ] Create an about me page
- [ ] Port over existing WP content that I actually care about
- [ ] Remove old WP blog and use actual domain to point to GitHub Pages
