# Tooling used
* GatsbyJS
* Contentful
* UIKit
* S3 and Cloudfront
* CircleCI

# How to run
* `yarn dev` to develop locally.
* `yarn generate` to build for production. Add and commit files and push to the repository for the changes to be made live.

# Things to do
- [ ] Create a contact form page
- [ ] Port over existing WP content that I actually care about
- [x] Move off the `blog` subdomain!
